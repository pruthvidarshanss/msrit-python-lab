b.Write lambda function to Read csv file and load it into tuples
c. Write  regular expression to search and display details of Associate professors with more than 15 years experience, assistant Professors with more than 5 years experience, Professors with more than 20 years experience.
d. Perform association rule mining of associate professors for their performance relations in different contributions like No. of publication and no of book chapters, No. of publication and amount of consultancy work.

## [`Program 8`]()

Write a Python program with objects and classes, to do the following.
a. Generate faculty data set with 1,00000 rows and put in csv file where experience linearly mapped to designation, salary, no of publication, no of book chapters, amount of consultancy work, fund received, professional membership.
b.Write lambda function to Read csv file and load it into tuples
c. Write  regular expression to search and display details of Associate professors with more than 15 years experience, assistant Professors with more than 5 years experience, Professors with more than 20 years experience.
d. Write lambda function and regular expression to search for associate professors with more than 25 years experience and load in another temp list called "asso_prof_25"
e. In asso_prof_25 list do the following factoring:
If experience > 25, yes means set the value as 1 else 0
If publication count > 5, yes means set the value as 1 else 0
If book-chapter count > 5, yes means set the value as 1 else 0
f. Perform the association rule mining of associate professors for the following performance relations in different contributions.
Experience, designation, no. of publications and no. of book chapters

## [`Program 9`]()

Write a Python program to do the following.
a.Create a csv file called "books.csv" with synthesized data set having the following columns: Student usn, semester-number, sub-code, subject name, book referred, book-id, grade scored.
b.Use exception handling for following file operations.
     i. Read the csv file content into local variables for accessing them in python
     ii. Extract only sem-number, sub-code, book-id and grade scored and store in another CSV file called "extracted-books.csv".
     When you write into the "extracted-books.csv", file Convert grade code to number (Sgrade-9, A grade-8,etc) and update into the file
     iii. Analyse the coorelation between sem-number, sub-code, book-id and grade scored
     iv. Convert the data set in required format to perform association rule mining an analyse the output
