# `Realtime Application Development Using Python`

## [`Program 1`](p1Faculty.py)

Create over 100000 data to a CSV file. Read it to list. Use menu operators to add, search, delete from the list.
Read experience(number) from user & display the faculty name, so that they can participate in BOS.

## [`Program 2`](p2Student.py)

Create synthetic dataset for student details over 100000 rows with student name, USN, CGPA, address, 
blood group, branch name, UG/PG, date of birth and year of studying. Then load dataset to tuple. Display menu for search. Dislpay the UG/PG students for a particular branch get the input from the user, where CGPA > 9.

## [`Program 3`](p3Weather.py)

Weather details displaying for a particular place given longitude & latitude in the globe. Read longitude & latitude values from the user and store weather details to a dictionary.

## [`Program 4`](p4Blink.py)

Write a Python program demonstrate continous blinking of a LED (blinking effect) using Raspberry PI and RPi.GPIO library

## [`Program 5`](p5SingleSequence.py)

Write a Python program demonstrate single sequence of turning ON the LED for one second and then turning it OFF.

## [`Program 6`](P6LDR.py)

Write a Python program to detect the intensity of light in surrounding using a LDR(Light Dependent Resistor) and display the LDR Value as output.

## [`Program 7`](p7LinearRegression.py)

1. Generate 100000 rows, synthesized faculty dataset where experience linearly mapped to designation, salary, no. of publications, no. of book chapters, amount of consultancy work, fund received, professional membership.
2. Read and load it into a list using function (try all the types of functions)
3. Find out the correlation among the fields in faculty dataset.
4. Perform the Linear regression analysis and plot the predicted value.

## [`Program 8`](p8MLFaculty.py)

Generate 100000 rows and put in csv file, sythesized faculty dataset where experience linearly mapped to designation,
salary, no. of publications, no. of chapters, amount of consultancy work, fund recieved, professional membership.

1. Read csv file and load it into tuple Tuple and Dictionary using Function, (try all the types of function)
2. Find out correlation among the fields in faculty dataset
3. Perform the following operations:
    1. Linear Regression analysis of following & plot the predicted value in separate graphs
    2. KNN analysis of following & plot the predicted value in separate graphs
    3. Apply Naiye Bayes algorithm for following & plot the predicted value in separate graphs (x-axis - experience, y-axis - predicted value)
         1. No. of publication
         2. No. of Book chapters
         3. AMount of Consultancy work
         4. Fund Received
         5. Professional Membership
